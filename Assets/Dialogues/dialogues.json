      "Hey kiddo, welcome to your first day undercover.",
      "I know, loads of pressure, but I know you'll do fine!",
      "Remember, we want to send as many customers away as possible.",
      "They'll have no other choice but to come back to me! Haha!",
      "Now, I know it isn't the most correct option but. hear me out.",
      "See all the products? Throw them at the customers, they'll go right out!",
      "It might be – different – but I assure you, it will work.",
      "Of course you can do other stuff, like leaving no stock of some product,",
      "turning off the fridges, or even stealing products from their bags.",
      "Anything is fair game my boy! You can do it, believe in yourself.",
      "Just be aware of you manager. He will be looking around from time to time.",
      "Just make sure there's enough products in the shelves, the floor is clean,",
      "the fridges are on, and that he doesn't spot you doing any funny business.",
      "He may be patient, at first, but if he complains too much, you'll be fired!",
      "See those things on the bottom right corner? Those are the manager stats.",
      "When the timer reaches 0, that means he is out lurking, be careful!",
      "The warning signs are STRIKES. Every time he sees something wrong, you get a strike.",
      "Once you get too many, you'll be fired, so watch out.",
      "Now, if you look at the top right corner, that's the amount of clients sent away.",
      "You have a daily minimum, set by yours truly, make sure you reach it!",
      "On the top left corner is your clock. Your shift is from 8AM to 5PM, so take that into consideration.",
      "Active tasks will be displayer along the left.",
      "Complete those to make sure your manager is happy.",
      "Well son, I think that's it for now. Oh, one more thing!",
      "Not all clients are 'reasonable'.",
      "Some will come to stop you in your tracks, kids may be running around. You may even find some thieves.",
      "While harder to handle, I'm sure you'll deal with them perfectly.",
      "Just drop their patience to 0, and they'll run right out.",
      "Well, time has come. Go and open the front doors. Good luck son!"
