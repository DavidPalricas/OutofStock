      "Hey kid, welcome to your first day undercover.",
      "I know, pressure, but you’ll do fine!",
      "Remember to send as many customers away as possible.",
      "There’ll be no choice but to come back to me! Haha!",
      "I know it isn’t the most correct way, but. Hear me out.",
      "See all the products?",
      "Throw them at them, they’ll go right out!",
      "I assure you, it will work.",
      "Of course you can do other stuff. Leave no stock,",
      "turn off the fridges, steal products from their bags.",
      "Anything is fair game! I know you can do it.",
      "Just be aware of the manager. He will be looking around.",
      "Make sure the shelves are full, the floor is clean,",
      "the fridges are on, and that he doesn’t catch you.",

      "Once you get too many, you’ll be fired, so watch out.",
      "Now, top right corner, those are clients sent away.",
      "You have a daily minimum, make sure you reach it!",
      "Top left corner is your clock. Your shift is from 8AM to 5PM.",
      "Active tasks will be displayed along the left.",
      "Complete them to make sure your manager is happy.",
      "And I think that’s it! Oh, one more thing!",
      "Not all clients are ‘reasonable’.",
      "Some will try to attack, kids may be running around.",
      "You may even find some thieves.",
      "Just drop their patience to 0, and they’ll leave.",
      "Well, time to open the front doors. Good luck son!"
