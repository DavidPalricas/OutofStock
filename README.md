**Game Overview**  
This game was developed as part of the [3D Game Project module](https://www.ua.pt/en/uc/15490) in the Digital Game Development master's programme at the University of Aveiro during the 2024/2025 academic year. The theme of this project was an **Unconventional Weapon**.

---
## Synopsis  
After years of hard work as a manager at a small grocery store, (character) is finally promoted to manage a local supermarket—a long-awaited step up in their career. However, this new role comes with an unexpected twist: they are now in charge of (supermarket), the busiest and most chaotic store in the area.  

Eager to prove their worth, (character) quickly realises that typical managerial tasks aren’t enough to keep the store running smoothly. From shoplifters to troublesome customers, (character) must handle a variety of unique and challenging individuals while juggling endless responsibilities, from restocking shelves to mopping floors—all with a small team and little time to breathe.  

To deal with these difficult customers, (character) resorts to unconventional methods, using whatever tools and products are at hand, from fresh tomatoes to the mop they’re cleaning with. It’s a radical approach, but one that might just keep these unruly visitors in line.  

With just four days to adapt to the frenetic pace of their new workplace, (character) must keep the supermarket under control and prepare for the ultimate test: the weekend sales. Facing massive crowds, persistent shoplifters, and endless chaos, (character) must prove they can handle the pressure—or risk being overwhelmed by the madness.  

Will (character) keep both the store and their sanity intact, or will they be swallowed by the chaos of the sales?
